README XMLReport example script

The scripts and documents in this directory are meant as a demonstration
of how the XMLReport can be used to automate web tests and to enhance
the output of HTTP::WebTest.

For a short demonstration, just run the shellscript 'webtest.sh'
from *this* directory. You need to have Gnome's LibXML installed
and the 'xsltproc' tool somewhere in your PATH.

A short description of the files in this directory:


o webtest      - Perl wrapper, parse XML input and call HTTP::WebTest
                 run 'webtest --help' for a short explanation
o testdefs.xml - Test definitions in XML format, just a bunch of
                 rather contrieved but nicely annotated examples
o transform/   - a bunch of XSLT stylesheets to convert XMLReport output
o webtest.sha  - shell wrapper around 'webtest' and 'xsltproc'

The following files are generated by running webtest.sh:

o out1.xml     - output of first test run, XMLReport format
o failed1.xml  - test definitions of tests that failed during the
                 first test run
o out2.xml     - otput of second test run
o result.xml   - merged result from 1st and 2nd test runs, enhanced
                 from the XMLReport format (more attributes)
o sidebar.html - summary of test results in html format, suitable for
                 the Mozilla sidebar
o content.html - detailed report in html format
email.txt      - failed test results formatted as email including
                 headers (suitable to send with sendmail).

Of course this is just a rough example, use your imagination to expand
on this concept!
